Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?


The app I created was an Inventory app, used for tracking quantities of items. The goal of this app was to create a user-friendly interface
that allowed users to add items, delete items, and edit the quantities of each item. The app also required the use of a database to save user information, 
such as usernames and passwords, and inventory items. This app was designed to meet the needs of anyone requiring a simple, efficient way to 
track the inventory of their items. 


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?


To meet user needs and produce a user-center UI, I created four different screens. The login screen is the first screen the user sees upon opening the app. The user can select “Login” after entering their username and password or select “Register” to create a new account. The Register screen is similar to the log-in screen, but the buttons are “Cancel” and “Register”. After logging in, the user is met with the “Home” page that displays their inventory. On this screen, the user can add, delete, and edit items. I also included an “SMS” button that took the user to a new screen to enable SMS notifications. Overall, to successfully create my app, I included four screens, multiple buttons, and multiple edit text boxes. My UI design is very simple. I wanted to create a simple, organized, straightforward app. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?


I tried to keep the coding process of my app as organized as possible. Each class and layout file was given a simple name to match one another. This made switching between the design and functionality aspect of this project extremely smooth. I also used in-line comments to detail what each function does and create separate methods for different functions.	


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?


I utilized the emulator in Android Studio to test if my code was functional. I do not have any Android devices, so the emulator was my only option. This process is extremely important because you can easily identify which blocks of code are not functioning correctly. I was able to resolve my issues quickly by constantly testing my application after minor adjustments. 


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?


I struggled with finding a way to increase and decrease the quantities of items. I utilized the same method I had created for deleting items and adjusted the code accordingly. 


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?


Instead of a specific component, I would say the entire app demonstrates my knowledge, skills, and experience. I went into this course and project with very limited knowledge and experience. I am completing this course and project with a functional mobile app that can be used to track an inventory of items.
